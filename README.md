# food_group_app

A group restaurant rating app, built in Flutter.

My friends and I like to try different restaurants around town. What I would
normally do is keep track of our individual ratings on a note in my phone. 

This app is to change that.

The purpose of this app is to allow a quick method to add and rate a restaurant you visit.
Anyone who joins you on your dining experience should have a say in the overall rating
you would give the restaurant. This is all bundled into a simple and friendly application
that you can reference back at any point.

## Building

The app requires two files to be created by the user when building.

`.env` should be filled with valid details, see `.env.example` for an example .env file.

`/android/secrets.properties` should be populated to allow Google Maps access **Note: This is not currently used**
